      <h2>End of the Year</h2>
      <p class="meta">Posted by Commish on December 31, 2024</p>
      <p><strong>1. The New Champ</strong> – 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

Well, the season has come to a close, and what a ride it's been! We have a new CHAMPION! Who would have thought this year could ever happen. A team that was second lowest points in the league offensively but a defense like we’ve never seen before. A team with a NEGATIVE point differential during the regular season. You’ve heard of the 85 Chicago Bears, the 2000 Baltimore Ravens, the Legion of Boom 2013 Seahawks. We now have the 2024 DAHGS which may top them all. Congrats to Jp. Truly a one of a kind run with the number one pick basically not playing the whole season. This one was truly - destiny. 

For the rest of the league, congrats to tucker for second and Tom for third place. The treasurer will be in contact soon if he hasn’t been already. Everyone else, get your dues in & start studying the board and mocking for 2025. 

Jp’s name will be the 11th name on thr trophy this year (after robs gets added as well). 11th name includes Galante’s asterisk year so this is the end of our 10th legit season. An end of a decade! 

Another decade starts in 2025. Another chance to add to the legacy of the corruption league. To me, this Jp 2024 run, opens up the next decade for anyone to make their mark on this league. 

See you all soon and have a happy new year!

Events committee will probably be in touch soon about something

      <h2>Rivalry Week</h2>

      <p><strong>Commish Doesn't Feel Like Doing Punishment</strong> – First of all congratulations to Tucker, Rob, Jf, Jp & the intern for winning rivalry week

There seems to have been a mixup of when the spice girls situation was supposed to happen. It would have made sense to do this on Halloween weekend (And we all were fine doing this) which was right around week 8 but I think that was last weekend. The losers are ready to roll for a punishment but I think the punishment has now changed to the second option which is the puzzle due to the date mixup which we clearly did not think about back in August. We will not be cross dressing on a random weekend as the vice commish has also mentioned. More details to follow from the punishment committee on when this will be occurring but if you have an issue with this, you might just be str8 gay or really weird, idk. Hope this clears things up.</p>
